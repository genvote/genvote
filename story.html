					<h4>We are millennials, activists, and campaign veterans looking to turn the political process upside down. We created a new model of engagement that disrupts the political process, empowers young people to take control of the narrative,  and change the direction of our local communities. We are a network of students conducting original student opinions research on our campuses, advocating for innovative local Youth Platforms, engaging with thousands of student voters and working with local progressive candidates across New York.<br><br>

					We are the next generation of politicians, teachers, doctors, and engineers. Our vote can determine the future of our country. To do this, we need to organize a bottom-up youth-driven movement. We need to be Generation Vote.</h4>
